        <div class="entry-content">
            <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites. It solves many problems
                which we had once, one of which is the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). All thanks
                to Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Bootstrap?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Faster and Easier Web-Development.</li>
                <li>It creates Platform-independent web-pages.</li>
                <li>It creates Responsive Web-pages.</li>
                <li>It designed to be responsive to mobile devices too.</li>
                <li>It is Free! Available on www.getbootstrap.com</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to use Bootstrap 4 in webpage:</strong> There are two ways to include Bootstrap in the website. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Include Bootstrap from CDN link.</li>
                <li>Download Bootstrap from getbootstrap.com and use it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>BootStrap 4 from CDN:</strong> This method of installing Bootstrap is easy. It is highly recommended to follow this method.</p>
            <center> <img src="c:/new webpage/boot1.jpg" height="700" width="1000"></center>
            <h4>Why is Bootstrap the go-to for web developers?</h4>

            <p> Let’s break the advantages down into 8 parts:
            </p>

            <h5>1. Bootstrap’s Responsive Grid</h5>
            No more spending hours coding your own grid—Bootstrap comes with its own grid system predefined!

            <br>Now, you can get straight to filling your containers with content.

            <br>Defining custom breakpoints for each column is a snap using their extra small, small, medium, large, and extra large breaks. You can also simply stick to the default as it might already meet the needs of your site.

            <h5>2. Bootstrap’s Responsive Images</h5>


            Bootstrap comes with its own code for automatically resizing images based on the current screen size. Just add the .img-responsive class to your images, and the predefined CSS rules take care of the rest.

            <br>Let Bootstrap resize your images for you!

            <br>It can even change the shape of your images with the addition of classes like img-circle and img-rounded, and that’s without going back and forth between the code and your design software.
            <h5>3. Bootstrap’s Components</h5>
            Bootstrap comes with a whole barrelful of components you can easily tack onto your web page, including:

            <br>Navigation bars
            <br>Dropdowns
            <br>Progress bars
            <br>Thumbnails
            <br>…and more!

            <br>Not only is it a breeze to add eye-catching design elements to your webpage, you’ll also be able to rest assured knowing that every one of them will look great no matter the screen size or device used to view them.

            <br>That’s a lot of ready-made functionality right at your fingertips!

            <br>For a more complete list of addable features, check out the component documentation.


            <h5>4. Bootstrap’s JavaScript</h5>


            Still not enough functions? Try JQuery!

            <br>Bootstrap also allows developers to take advantage of over a dozen custom JQuery plugins. JQuery gives you even more room to play with interactivity, offering up easy solutions for modal popups, transitions, image carousels, and—one of
            my personal favorites—a plugin called scrollspy, which automatically updates your navigation bar as you scroll through a page.


            <h5>5. Bootstrap’s Documentation</h5>


            Bootstrap’s documentation is some of the best I’ve ever seen. Every piece of code is described and explained in explicit detail on their website. Explanations also include code samples for basic implementation, simplifying the process for even the most
            beginner of beginners. All you need to do is choose a component, copy and paste the code into your page, and tweak from there.

            <h5>6. Bootstrap’s Customizability</h5>
            One of the main critiques when it comes to frameworks such as Bootstrap is their size—the weight they throw around can really slow down your application upon first load. The current version of Bootstrap’s CSS file, for example, is a whopping 119 KB. While
            this may not seem especially large compared to image and video files, for a CSS file, that’s enormous! What Bootstrap allows you to do to combat this, however, is customize which functionality you want to include in your download. By simply
            going to their customize and download page, you can check off the features you won’t need for your application, trimming the weight off your file and saving your users the additional load time. Customization is key!

            <h5>7. Bootstrap’s Community</h5>
            As with so many open-source projects, Bootstrap has a large community of designers and developers behind it. Being hosted on GitHub makes it easy for developers to modify and contribute to Bootstrap’s codebase. It also makes it easy for people to collaborate,
            lend their advice, and interact with peers and fellow users. Bootstrap has an active Twitter page, a Bootstrap blog, and even a dedicated Slack room. And that doesn’t even get into the wealth of developers willing to help with technical problems
            on Stack Overflow, where all questions can be found under the bootstrap-4 tag.

            <h5> 8. Bootstrap’s External Templates</h5>
            As the popularity of Bootstrap grew, people started creating templates based on Bootstrap in order to accelerate the web development process even further. There are many websites out there dedicated to sharing and buying custom templates based on Bootstrap.

        </div>

        <h5>Why Shouldn’t You Use Bootstrap?</h5>
        By now, you’re probably thinking that using Bootstrap is a no-brainer!

        <br>But remember that there are two sides to every coin.

        <br>Like most everything in life, <b>even Bootstraps has its downsides</b>.

        <br>Let’s take a quick look at some common complaints you might hear about Bootstrap:<br>

        <br><b>Bootstrap Syntax is Confusing!</b>
        <br>

        <br>Before you become familiar with Bootstrap, some of its syntax can be confusing. When using the grid system, for example, in order to make a column that takes up a third of the screen, you have to add the .col-md-4 class to it.
        <br>4? Where did this 4 come from?! <br>Undoubtedly, the four might lead you to believe the column would take up a quarter of the screen—not a third. While this syntax does make sense (Bootstrap uses a 12-column system, and 4 is a third of 12),
        it can be unintuitive for those new to the whole process.<br><b> Bootstrap Files are Too Big!</b><br> As mentioned earlier, Bootstrap files can be a bit, well, large to account for the sheer functionality offered by its framework. This can lead
        to an increase in load times for websites, especially on slower networks. <br>Beginners might have a hard time identifying and fixing this issue; however, as mentioned above, the customize tool on Bootstrap’s website can help eliminate any unnecessary
        code for functions you’ll never use.<br> Bootstrap—have it your way! <br>Just pick out the bits you need and leave the rest. (Of course, this task gets easier the more you know about coding!) <br><b>Bootstrap Keeps Me from Actually Learning Code! </b>
        <br>There’s always the risk that, by using Bootstrap, you’ll get into a cycle of simply recycling existing code without actually understanding it. By spending the time to really learn what you’re doing, however, you can use Bootstrap as a way
        of accelerating your learning, rather than hindering it.
