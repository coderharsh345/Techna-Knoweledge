            <p> C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level
                access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.<br> Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly
                or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).<br> Structure
                of a C program:-<br> After the above discussion, we can formally assess the structure of a C program. By structure, it is meant that any program can be written in this structure only. Writing a C program in any other structure will hence
                lead to a Compilation Error

                C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language.<br> C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the
                advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.Some of the features & key-points to note about
                the programming language are as follows:
                <br>1. Simple: It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich libray support and a variety of data-types. <br>2. Machine Independent but Platform Dependent: A C++ executable
                is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are machine independent. <br>3. Mid-level language: It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking
                etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)</p>

            </li>
            <p>Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public
                License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.<br> Why to Learn Python?<br> * Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly
                readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
                <br> * Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:
                <br>* Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
                <br> * Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
                <br> * Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
                <br> * Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</p>

            <p>What is CSS?
                <br> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                <br>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                <br>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once

            </li>
            <p>The term PHP is an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.

                <br> Websites like www.facebook.com, www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.
                <br>One of the main reason behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file.
                <br>The thing that differentiates PHP with client-side language like HTML is, PHP codes are executed on server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are first executed on the server and then the result is returned
                to the browser.
                <br>The only information that the client or browser knows is the result returned after executing the PHP script on the server and not the actual PHP codes present in the PHP file. Also, PHP files can support other client-side scripting
                languages like CSS and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. <br> History of JavaScript: It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich
                while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language
                in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser.

                <br>Features of JavaScript: According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most popular language on earth.
                <br> With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with Node.js and other frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more.</p>

            <p>
                SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language that's used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them. Initially created in the 1970s, SQL is regularly used not only by database administrators,
                but also by developers writing data integration scripts and data analysts looking to set up and run analytical queries.
                <br>The uses of SQL include modifying database table and index structures; adding, updating and deleting rows of data; and retrieving subsets of information from within a database for transaction processing and analytics applications.
                Queries and other SQL operations take the form of commands written as statements -- commonly used SQL statements include select, add, insert, update, delete, create, alter and truncate.</p>

            <p>Android is an open source operating system, based on Linux kernel and used in mobile devices like smartphones, tablets etc. Further, it was developed for smart watches and Android TV. Each of them has a specialized interface.

                <br> Android was developed by the company Open Handset Alliance (OHA), led by Google. The Open Handset Alliance (OHA) is consortium of multiple companies like Samsung, Sony, Intel and many more to provide a services and deploy handsets
                using android platform.

                <br>Because it is Android Open Source Project(AOSP) licensed under the Apache license, many developers has been contributed in android development. The primary goal of the android project is to create product that can be implemented in
                user’s life.

                <br>Initially, Android development was started by Android Inc., later bought by Google in year 2005. It’s first commercial version was released in September 2008. Since then, different number of versions have been released with extraordinary

                License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.<br> Why to Learn Python?<br> * Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly
                readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
                <br> * Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:
                <br>* Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
                <br> * Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
                <br> * Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
                <br> * Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</p>

            <p>Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language and platform. A platform is an environment that helps to develop and run programs written in any programming language.
                <br> Java is fast, reliable and secure. From desktop to web applications, scientific supercomputers to gaming consoles, cell phones to the Internet, Java is used in every nook and corner. <br> However to become proficient in any programming
                language, one Firstly needs to understand the basics of that language.</p>

            <p>What is CSS?
                <br> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                <br>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                <br>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                <br>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>

            </li>
            <p>The term PHP is an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.

                <br> Websites like www.facebook.com, www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.
                <br>One of the main reason behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file.
                <br>The thing that differentiates PHP with client-side language like HTML is, PHP codes are executed on server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are first executed on the server and then the result is returned
                to the browser.
                <br>The only information that the client or browser knows is the result returned after executing the PHP script on the server and not the actual PHP codes present in the PHP file. Also, PHP files can support other client-side scripting
                languages like CSS and JavaScript.</p>

            </li>
            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. <br> History of JavaScript: It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich
                while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language
                in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser.

                <br>Features of JavaScript: According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most popular language on earth.
                <br> With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with Node.js and other frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more.</p>

            <p>
                SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language that's used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them. Initially created in the 1970s, SQL is regularly used not only by database administrators,
                but also by developers writing data integration scripts and data analysts looking to set up and run analytical queries.
                <br>The uses of SQL include modifying database table and index structures; adding, updating and deleting rows of data; and retrieving subsets of information from within a database for transaction processing and analytics applications.
                Queries and other SQL operations take the form of commands written as statements -- commonly used SQL statements include select, add, insert, update, delete, create, alter and truncate.</p>

            <p>Android is an open source operating system, based on Linux kernel and used in mobile devices like smartphones, tablets etc. Further, it was developed for smart watches and Android TV. Each of them has a specialized interface.

                <br> Android was developed by the company Open Handset Alliance (OHA), led by Google. The Open Handset Alliance (OHA) is consortium of multiple companies like Samsung, Sony, Intel and many more to provide a services and deploy handsets
                using android platform.

                <br>Because it is Android Open Source Project(AOSP) licensed under the Apache license, many developers has been contributed in android development. The primary goal of the android project is to create product that can be implemented in
                user’s life.

                <br>Initially, Android development was started by Android Inc., later bought by Google in year 2005. It’s first commercial version was released in September 2008. Since then, different number of versions have been released with extraordinary
                features.

            <p>To crack passwords or to steal data? No, it is much more than that. Ethical hacking is to scan vulnerabilities and to find potential threats on a computer or networks. An ethical hacker finds the weak points or loopholes in a computer, web
                applications or network and reports them to the organization. So, let’s explore more about Ethical Hacking step-by-step.

                <br> These are various types of hackers:

                <br> (1) White Hat Hackers (Cyber-Security Hacker)
                <br>(2) Black Hat Hackers (Cracker)
