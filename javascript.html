            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. <br> History of JavaScript: It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich
                while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language
                in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser.
                <br>Features of JavaScript: According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most popular language on earth.
                <br> With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with Node.js and other frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more.</p>
        </ol>
        <h3>How do JavaScript engines work?</h3>
        <p> JavaScript Engines are complicated. But it works on some simple basics:</p>
        <ol>
            <ul>
                <li>The engine reads ("parses:) the script.</li>
                <li>Then it converts or compiles the script to the machine language.</li>
                <li>After that machine code runs.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>Here, JavaScript engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It reads a compiled script and analyzes the data that passes in JavaScript engine. After that, it applies optimizations to the machine code from that acquired knowledge.
            When this process is completed, scripts run quite fast.</p>
        <h3>What can in-browser JavaScript do?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript's functionality depends on the environment it's running in. For example, Node.js supports functions which allows JavaScript to read and write arbitrary files, perform network requests, object-oriented, etc. The roles that JavaScript
            plays in both client-side (front end) and server-side (back end) development of applications can vary wildly. </p>
        <p>In-browser JavaScript also allows you to perform webpage manipulation, interaction with the user and with the web server.</p>
        <h3>Javascript offer advantages like: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Show dynamic content based on the user profile.</li>
            <li>React to user's operations, like mouse clicks events, key presses or pointer movements. </li>
            <li>Support features like auto-validated form entries and interactive drop-down menus. </li>
            <li>Send requests to remote servers, Upload and download files. </li>
            <li>JavaScript code can also create movement and sound </li>
            <li>Ask questions to the users, Get and set cookies, show messages, switch browser tabs.</li>
            <li>Allows the data on to be stored in the local storage.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What can't in-browser JavaScript do?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript's capabilities in the browser are quite limited for the sake of the user's safety. It helps to prevent any unauthorized webpage from accessing private information.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples of such limitations are: </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript on a webpage may not allow you to copy, execute or read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk. It doesn't offer any access to Operating system functions.</li>
            <li>Many browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is very limited and only provided if the user is performing a specific action like, dropping a file into a browser window or selecting using &lt;input&gt; tag.</li>
            <li>JavaScript allows you to communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. Although, it does not allow you to receive data from other sites/domains. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What makes JavaScript unique?</h3>
        <p>Here, are the three most important features which make JavaScript unique</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It offers full integration with HTML/CSS.</li>
            <li>Simple things are done quickly without any complication or following strict rules.</li>
            <li>Supported by all major browsers and JavaScript is enabled by default.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Alternatives to JavaScript</h3>
        <p>The syntax of JavaScript not suited for everyone as different project demands different features. However, some modern tool like a Coffee script, Typescript, and Dart allowing developers to code in another language and then auto-convert into the
            JavaScript code.
        </p>
        <h3>Where is JavaScript Today?</h3>
        <p>ECMAScript is a specification governed by ECMA international aimed at standardizing JavaScript. The latest version is ECMA9 also called JavaScript 9. It is supported by all major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. Though each
            browser has an array of unique commands that are not part of the standards.</p>
