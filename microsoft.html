                related services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Offic suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game
                consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. In 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue (currently Alphabet Google has more revenue).The word "Microsoft" is aportmanteau of "microcomputer"
                and "software". Microsoft is ranked No. 30 in the 2018 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.It is considered one of the Big Five technology companies alongside Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook.
            </p>
            <p>Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft
                Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified
                from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016, followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion
                in May 2011.

            <p>Childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen sought to make a business utilizing their shared skills in computer programming.In 1972, they founded Traf-O-Data which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data. Gates
                enrolled at Harvard while Allen pursued a degree in computer science at Washington State University, though he later dropped out of school to work at Honeywell. The January 1975 issue of <i>Popular Electronics</i> featured Micro Instrumentation
                and Telemetry Systems (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and claimed that he had a working interpreter, and MITS requested a demonstration.
                Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter, and it worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in March 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair
                BA Gates and Allen established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as the CEO, and Allen suggested the name "Micro-Soft", short for micro-computer software. In August 1977, the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan,
                resulting in its first international office of "ASCII Microsoft".Microsoft moved its headquarters to Bellevue, Washington in January.
            </p>
            <p><b>Microsoft</b> entered the operating system (OS) business in 1980 with its own version of Unix called Xenix, but it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance.IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version
                of the CP/M OS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC). For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it branded as MS-DOS, although IBM rebranded it to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft
                retained ownership of MS-DOS following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, so other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such
                restriction applied to the operating systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor. The company expanded into new markets with the release of the <i>Microsoft Mouse</i> in 1983, as well as with a publishing
                division named Microsoft Press. Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after developing Hodgkin 's disease Allen claimed in Idea Man:<i>A Memoir by the Co-founder of Microsoft</i> that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company
                when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease because he did not think that he was working hard enough. Allen late invested in low-tech sectors, sports teams, commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space flight, and more.</p>

            <p>
                <b>Microsoft Excel</b> are numbers of spreadsheet programs but from all of them, Excel is most widely used. People have been using it for last 30 years and throughout these years, it has been upgraded with more and more features. The best
                part about Excel is, it can apply to many business tasks, including statistics, finance, data management, forecasting, analysis, inventory, billing, and business intelligence.
                <br> Three most important components of Excel is which you need to understand first: <br><b>1)</b>Cell: A cell is a smallest but most powerful part of a spreadsheet. You can enter your data into a cell either by typing or by copy-paste.
                Data can be a text, a number, or a date. You can also customize it by changing its size, font color, background color, borders, etc. Every cell is identified by its cell address, cell address contains its column number and row number (If
                a cell is on 11th row and on column AB, then its address will be AB11).<br><b>2)</b> Worksheet: A worksheet is made up of individual cells which can contain a value, a formula, or text. It also has an invisible draw layer, which holds
                charts, images, and diagrams. Each worksheet in a workbook is accessible by clicking the tab at the bottom of the workbook window. In addition, a workbook can store chart sheets; a chart sheet displays a single chart and is accessible
                by clicking a tab.<br><b>3)</b> Workbook: A workbook is a separate file just like every other application has. Each workbook contains one or more worksheets. You can also say that a workbook is a collection of multiple worksheets or can
                be a single worksheet. You can add or delete worksheets, hide them within the workbook without deleting them, and change the order of your worksheets within the workbook. </p>

            <p><b>Microsoft Access </b>is a type of database software that is used to store information for reporting, referencing and analysis. With Microsoft Access, you can analyze large amounts of data faster and more efficiently than with Excel or other
                types of spreadsheets.

                <br> If you’ve been considering a database application for your business, or you’re finding that traditional spreadsheets just aren’t cutting it anymore, Microsoft Access may be just what you’re looking for.

                <br>Let’s explore some of the basic functions of Access and how they can help your business be more productive.

                <br>Short Introduction to Microsoft Access

                <br>Access is most popular for its tables, forms and queries. The database tables are similar to spreadsheets, so you shouldn’t have much trouble using the basic functions of the program. However, it does take time to learn the full features.

                <br>When setting up a database, you may list the subject matter of each column, just as you would with a spreadsheet, and add as many columns as you’d like. When this is completed, each row leaves room for more data input.

                <br> One feature that users really like is that they don’t need to finalize the tables manually. Also, Access has a query function that allows information to be combined from more than one table, and you can even specify the conditions.
                This saves a lot of time because you don’t have to look through rows and rows of information.</p>

                    version of the CP/M OS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC). For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it branded as MS-DOS, although IBM rebranded it to IBM PC DOS.
                    Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, so other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles,
                    but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor. The company expanded into new markets with the release of the <i>Microsoft Mouse</i> in 1983, as well as
                    with a publishing division named Microsoft Press. Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after developing Hodgkin 's disease Allen claimed in Idea Man:<i>A Memoir by the Co-founder of Microsoft</i> that Gates wanted to dilute his
                    share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease because he did not think that he was working hard enough. Allen late invested in low-tech sectors, sports teams, commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space
                    flight, and more.</p>

                <p>
                    <b>Microsoft Excel</b> are numbers of spreadsheet programs but from all of them, Excel is most widely used. People have been using it for last 30 years and throughout these years, it has been upgraded with more and more features. The
                    best part about Excel is, it can apply to many business tasks, including statistics, finance, data management, forecasting, analysis, inventory, billing, and business intelligence.
                    <br> Three most important components of Excel is which you need to understand first: <br><b>1)</b>Cell: A cell is a smallest but most powerful part of a spreadsheet. You can enter your data into a cell either by typing or by copy-paste.
                    Data can be a text, a number, or a date. You can also customize it by changing its size, font color, background color, borders, etc. Every cell is identified by its cell address, cell address contains its column number and row number
                    (If a cell is on 11th row and on column AB, then its address will be AB11).<br><b>2)</b> Worksheet: A worksheet is made up of individual cells which can contain a value, a formula, or text. It also has an invisible draw layer, which
                    holds charts, images, and diagrams. Each worksheet in a workbook is accessible by clicking the tab at the bottom of the workbook window. In addition, a workbook can store chart sheets; a chart sheet displays a single chart and is accessible
                    by clicking a tab.<br><b>3)</b> Workbook: A workbook is a separate file just like every other application has. Each workbook contains one or more worksheets. You can also say that a workbook is a collection of multiple worksheets or
                    can be a single worksheet. You can add or delete worksheets, hide them within the workbook without deleting them, and change the order of your worksheets within the workbook. </p>

                <h5>Introduction of Microsoft Acess</h5>
                <p><b>Microsoft Access </b>is a type of database software that is used to store information for reporting, referencing and analysis. With Microsoft Access, you can analyze large amounts of data faster and more efficiently than with Excel
                    or other types of spreadsheets.

                    <br> If you’ve been considering a database application for your business, or you’re finding that traditional spreadsheets just aren’t cutting it anymore, Microsoft Access may be just what you’re looking for.

                    <br>Let’s explore some of the basic functions of Access and how they can help your business be more productive.

                    <br>Short Introduction to Microsoft Access

                    <br>Access is most popular for its tables, forms and queries. The database tables are similar to spreadsheets, so you shouldn’t have much trouble using the basic functions of the program. However, it does take time to learn the full
                    features.

                    <br>When setting up a database, you may list the subject matter of each column, just as you would with a spreadsheet, and add as many columns as you’d like. When this is completed, each row leaves room for more data input.

                    <br> One feature that users really like is that they don’t need to finalize the tables manually. Also, Access has a query function that allows information to be combined from more than one table, and you can even specify the conditions.
                    This saves a lot of time because you don’t have to look through rows and rows of information.</p>
